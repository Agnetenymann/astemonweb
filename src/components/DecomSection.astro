        title="PLASTIC BAG"
        content="It takes about <strong>10-20 years</strong> for a plastic bag to decompose, and why it matters. Plastic bags are not biodegradable. Instead, they gradually break down over time into smaller and smaller plastic particles."
      />
      <DeItem
        title="BALLOON"
        content="Balloons are often used at big celebrations. Unfortunately, we often forget the consequences that balloon releases have for nature. When a burst balloon falls back down, they can have a destructive impact on animals. Even though latex is biodegradable, the latex used in balloons is processed, and therefore takes up to <strong>4 years</strong> to break down in nature."

      <DeItem
        title="CIGARETTE BUD"
        content="It takes around <strong>1–5 years</strong> for a cigarette butt to break down into microplastics. The filter is made from cellulose acetate, a non-biodegradable type of plastic that turns into microplastics."
      />
      <DeItem
        title="ALUMINIUM CAN"
        content="The decomposition time for metal in the form of aluminum cans is estimated to be up to <strong>500 years</strong>."
      />
      <DeItem
        title="ICE CREAM STICK"
        content="Ice cream sticks made of wood are a natural and biodegradable material. However, the sticks are treated with a food-grade wax that prevents the ice cream from absorbing into the wood. Because of this treatment, an ice cream stick can take up to <strong>10 years</strong> to break down in nature."

      <DeItem
        title="CHEWING GUM"
        content="There are different estimates for how long chewing gum takes to break down in nature. Some say <strong>5 years</strong>, others <strong>20–25 years</strong>, and others claim it is not biodegradable at all. This is because it is made from synthetic rubber, sharing many characteristics with other rubber-based products such as car tires and adhesives. Synthetic rubber is strong, elastic, and resistant to harsh chemicals. It is a powerful binding agent and retains its properties under all weather conditions."
      />
      <DeItem
        title="FISHING LINE"
        content="Fishing line can take up to <strong>600 years</strong> to break down in nature. Its strong, synthetic material is designed to resist tension and harsh conditions, which makes it extremely slow to degrade."
      />
      <DeItem
        title="PLASTIC BOTTLE"
        content="PET plastic bottles are not biodegradable. Research suggests that a PET bottle stays intact for about <strong>15 years</strong> before it begins breaking down into microplastic. Full degradation is estimated to take <strong>400–1000 years</strong>, and scientists still don’t know whether microplastic ever fully disappears from nature."
      />
      <DeItem
        title="PAPER BAG"
        content="A paper bag is made from organic, water-soluble material, and because of this natural composition, it typically breaks down in the environment in about <strong>1 month</strong>."
      />
      <DeItem
        title="GLASS"
        content="Glass is such a durable material that its estimated decomposition time is over <strong>1 million years</strong>. Because it does not break down naturally in the environment, glass can remain intact for geological timescales unless it is physically shattered. This durability is also why recycling glass is so important, it can be melted down and reused endlessly without losing quality."
